Description:Write a program that simulates a simple bank ATM system.
The user has an initial balance of $1000. The ATM should display a menu with options to:

    Check Balance
    Deposit Money
    Withdraw Money
    Exit

The program should run in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
For each option, use if, elif, and else to manage each choice.
Ensure that the balance doesnâ€™t go below zero during a withdrawal.
